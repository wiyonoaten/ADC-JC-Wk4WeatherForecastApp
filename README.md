# JC-WeatherForecastApp

![Workflow result](https://github.com/wiyonoaten/ADC-JC-Wk4WeatherForecastApp/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description

This is the single-screen weather forecast app I have done for submission to the Week 4 challenge of the Android Dev Challenge (Jetpack Compose).

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

#### Highlights include:
* Simple and visually pleasing immersive design (I hope so!)
* Using many features/practices of Jetpack Compose such as Theming, CompositionLocal, Preview, MutableState, Modifier, Slots
* Architecture based on ViewModel, Repository, Coroutines
* Use of animations and gestures
* Fully functioning Previews
* Proper accessibility support
* Instrumentation testing is covered

#### Some novelties:
* Custom integration of DropdownMenu
* Animated gradient background
* Swipable screen to switch between views
* Custom modifier to check measurement
* Custom implementation of scrollable header
* Custom rendering using Canvas and graphics

Last but not least, the code has in fact been prepared ready to plug in easily with real data, such as those powered by OpenWeather API. However, I didn't manage to do this by submission, so the app is currently using stub data done at repository level.
